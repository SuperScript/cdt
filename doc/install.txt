== Instructions

=== Installing Under +/package+

These instructions describe an installation of a versioned distribution under
+/package+.  If you choose to install under a different prefix, replace
+/package+ with your choice of prefix in the steps that follow.

Download the {package} package.  The most recent {package} package is
link:{package}-{version}.tar.gz[{package} {version}].

If necessary, create a +/package+ directory:
!!!!
mkdir /package
chmod 1755 /package
!!!!

Unpack {package} in +/package+.
!!!!
cd /package
gunzip {package}-{version}.tar
tar -xpf {package}-{version}.tar
rm {package}-{version}.tar
cd {path}/{package}-{version}
!!!!

Determine the list of directories to symlink commands into by editing the
+package/command-ln+ file.  The default is
+/package/host/superscript.com/command+.

Determine the list of directories to copy commands into by editing the
+package/command-cp+ file.  The default is none.

Compile the package:
!!!!
package/compile
!!!!
This compiles programs and copies them to the +commands/+ directory.

Run some tests:
!!!!
package/rts
!!!!
If the tests fail you will see a message indicating where to look for more
information.

Install the package.  This will compile the package if you have not already done
so:
!!!!
package/install
!!!!
