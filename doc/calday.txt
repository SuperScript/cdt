== NAME
calday - print date ranges

== SYNOPSIS
!!!!
calday [ -bfBYMW -y _n_ -m _n_ -d _n_ -D _n_ -L _date_ -i _date_ -o _date_ -O _date_ -w _weekdays_ ] [ _date_ ... ]
!!!!

== DESCRIPTION
The +calday+ program scans a set of input dates and for each one prints a range
of output dates.  Input dates appear on the command line, or are read from
standard input if the +-f+ option is used.  Options determine the input and
output date formats, transformations on input dates, and the range of output
dates per input date.

Dates are in either ISO format (+YYYY-MM-DD+) or basic format (+YYYYMMDD+).
The ISO format requires at least one year digit but otherwise permits arbitrary
numbers of digits per component.  The basic format requires two digits for month
and day, but permits zero or more year digits.  The +calday+ program also
accepts a leading minus sign on each component of an ISO or basic format input
dates.  

By default, +calday+ works with dates in ISO format.

For each input date, +calday+ performs the following steps:

* Normalize to a calendar date.

* Set the date components per options.

* Apply input offsets per options.

* Calculate the date range to print.

* Apply output offsets per options.

* Filter dates per day-of-week constraints.

By default +caldate+ prints all dates in the range.  The +i+ option supports
alternative date intervals.

== EXIT STATUS
The +calday+ program prints a synopsis to standard error and exits 100 for a
permanent error, and exits 111 for a temporary error.  Otherwise it exits 0.

== OPTIONS

=== INPUT OPTIONS
Scanning:

+-b+::
Scan input dates in basic format.  Applies to all input dates and also to
subsequent options that take date arguments.

+-f+::
Read input dates from standard input instead of command line arguments.

Transformation phase 1:

+-d _n_+::
Set the day of each input date to +_n_+.
This applies only to input dates and not to option arguments.

+-m _n_+::
Set the month of each input date to +_n_+.
This applies only to input dates and not to option arguments.

+-y _n_+::
Set the year of each input date to +_n_+.
This applies only to input dates and not to option arguments.


Transformation phase 2:

+-o _date_+::
Apply an offset to each input date by adding each date component to the
corresponding component of the input date.

=== RANGE OPTIONS
The options +D+, +L+, +M+, +W+, and +Y+ are mutually exclusive.  The last one to
appear controls.

+-D _n_+::
Set range of +_n_+ days starting with the input date.

+-L _date_+::
Set range starting with the input date and ending with +_date_+.
The limit date is not included in the range, and is an upper or lower limit
depending on whether the increment between dates in the range counts up or down.

+-M+::
Set range covering the month containing the input date.

+-W+::
Set range covering the week containing the input date.

+-Y+::
Set range covering the year containing the input date.

+-i _date_+::
Find the next output date in the range by adding each date component to the last
output date and normalizing.


=== OUTPUT OPTIONS
+-B+::
Use basic format for output dates.

+-O _date_+::
Apply an offset to each output date by adding each date component to the
corresponding component of the output date and normalizing.

+-w _weekdays_+::
Print output only if the output day of week appears in comma-separated list
+_weekdays_+, where Sunday is day 0.
