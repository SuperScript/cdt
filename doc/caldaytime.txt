== DESCRIPTION
The +caldaytime+ program scans a set of input datetimes and for each one prints
a range of output datetimes.  Input datetimes appear on the command line, or are
read from standard input if the +-f+ option is used.  Options determine the
input and output datetime formats, transformations on input datetimes, and the
range of output datetimes per input datetime.

Datetimes are in either ISO format (+YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssXhhmm+) or
basic format (+YYYYMMDDhhmmss+).  Each component of a datetime may include a
leading minus sign.  The ISO format requires at least one year digit but
otherwise permits arbitrary numbers of digits per component.  Whitespace may
appear in place of the literal +T+, and before the sign +X+, which is either
+\++ or +-+.  The timezone offset +hhmm+ must consist of four characters, two
for hours and two for minutes.  The basic format requires two digits for month,
day, hour, minute, and second, but permits zero or more year digits.  The basic
format does not support a timezone offset.

By default, +caldaytime+ works with dates in ISO format.

For each input datetime, +caldaytime+ performs the following steps:
* Normalize to a calendar datetime.
* Set the datetime components per options.
* Apply input offsets per options.
* Calculate the datetime range to print.
* Apply output offsets per options.
* Filter datetimes per day-of-week constraints.

By default +caldatetime+ prints all datetimes in the range.  The +i+ option
supports alternative datetime intervals.

== EXIT STATUS
The +caldaytime+ program prints a synopsis to standard error and exits 100 for a
permanent error, and exits 111 for a temporary error.  Otherwise it exits 0.

== OPTIONS

=== INPUT OPTIONS
Scanning:

+-b+::
Scan datetimes in basic format.  Applies to all datetime inputs, including
subsequent arguments.

+-f+::
Read base datetimes from standard input and not command line.

Transformation phase 1:

+-d _n_+::
Set base datetime day to +_n_+.

+-h _n_+::
Set base datetime hour to +_n_+.

+-m _n_+::
Set base datetime month to +_n_+.

+-s _n_+::
Set base datetime second to +_n_+.

+-u _n_+::
Set base datetime minute to +_n_+.

+-y _n_+::
Set base datetime year to +_n_+.

+-z _n_+::
Set base datetime timezone offset to +_n_+.

Transformation phase 2:

+-o _datetime_+::
Pre-range offset.

=== RANGE OPTIONS
The options +D+, +L+, +M+, +W+, and +Y+ are mutually exclusive.  The last one to
appear controls.

+-D _n_+::
Set range of +_n_+ days starting with the input datetime.

+-L _datetime_+::
Set range starting with the input datetime and ending with +_datetime_+.
The limit datetime is not included in the range, and is an upper or lower limit
depending on whether the increment between datetimes in the range counts up or
down.

+-M+::
Set range covering the month containing the input datetime.

+-W+::
Set range covering the week containing the input datetime.

+-Y+::
Set range covering the year containing the input datetime.

+-i _datetime_+::
Find the next output datetime in the range by adding each datetime component to
the last output datetime and normalizing.

=== OUTPUT OPTIONS

+-B+::
Use basic format for output datetimes.

+-O _datetime_+::
Apply an offset to each output datetime by adding each datetime component to the
corresponding component of the output datetime and normalizing.

+-w _weekdays_+::
Print output only if ouput day of week appears in comma-separated list
+_weekdays_+, where Sunday is day 0.
